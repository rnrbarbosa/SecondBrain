# Ansible Custom Modules

write a blog post on how to develop an ansible module

Ansible is an open-source automation platform that can be used to configure and deploy systems in a repeatable and automated fashion. It simplifies the process of configuration management, allowing you to automate common tasks such as software installation, configuration, and deployment.

Ansible modules are the building blocks of Ansible playbooks. They are small pieces of code that can be used to perform a specific task such as installing a package or configuring a service. If youâ€™re looking to develop custom Ansible modules, this blog post will cover the basics of how to get started.

First, you will need to install Ansible on your computer. To do this, you can either use a package manager such as Homebrew or download the source code from GitHub.
